# tealdeer

This extension extends the [tldr](https://www.raycast.com/pomdtr/tldr) extension to support [tealdeer](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer). It allows you to show your custom cheatsheets in Raycast, not just the ones in the [tldr-pages repository](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).

tealdeer is a very fast implementation of tldr in Rust. Simplified, example based and community-driven man pages.
